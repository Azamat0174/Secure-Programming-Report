# Introduction
In this practical session, we will learn and apply our knowledge on threat finndings, their mitigations using compilation options, or directly modifying the code itself. Lastly, we will present our some recommendation on improving the process.

# Options used for Legacy version
In this, we explored the various options that might have been used to compile our original door-locker binary. The compilation flags we will put into `LEGCFLAGS=` and the linker flags we will put `LEGLDFRLAGS=`.

## Compilation options (LEGCFLAGS)
### `-fno-stack-protector`
With the use of checksec tool, we saw that the provided `door-locker` binary doesn't have the canary. Thus, we assume that the flags `-fno-stack-protector` must have been used to disable stack protection. 
Stack protection is a security feature that helps prevent stack buffer overflow attacks. It works by inserting a stack canary value before the return address in a function's stack frame. During execution, the program checks this canary value before returning from a function. If the canary value has been altered (indicating a potential overflow), the program terminates with a security error.
For security purpose, stack-protection must be enabled. Thus, either `-fstack-protection` or `-fstack-protection-all` options must be used.

### `-D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=0`
`D_FORTIFY_SOURCE` option enables or disables additional buffer overflow checks for standard library functions. It checks the size of buffers and flags issues if they exceed their allocated memory. However, for security purpose, it's value must be 2.

## Linker options (LEGLDFRLAGS)
### `-m32`
The -m32 flag instructs the compiler and linker to generate a 32-bit binary, regardless of the host system's architecture (commonly 64-bit)

# Identified threats and their mitigation
In this section, we will try to implement the mitigations we proposed in previous report. 

## Mitigations for Buffor overflow
For mitigation of Buffer overflow vulnerability we are applying the following approach:

<!--  -->

## Mitigations for visibility of Sensitive function


## alternative of 'strtol'

## Improved user feedback and error message


# Recommendation for future processes
